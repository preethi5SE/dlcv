Set Up Google Colab Environment:

Open a new notebook in Google Colab.
Ensure GPU is enabled by navigating to Runtime > Change runtime type and setting the hardware accelerator to GPU.
Install Required Libraries:

Install essential libraries if they are not already available in Colab (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, Kaggle).
Kaggle API Setup:


Download Dataset from Kaggle:

Unzip the downloaded dataset and verify the presence of train, validation, and test folders.
Organize Dataset:

Confirm the dataset's directory structure for train, validation, and test sets.
Organize the folders so that each class has its own folder within the respective train, validation, and test folders.
Import Libraries for Data Preprocessing and Model Building:

Import TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries for preprocessing and model building.
Data Preprocessing:

Use image data generators to preprocess the images for augmentation and resizing to match the Inception modelâ€™s input size (e.g., 299x299 pixels).
Set up separate generators for train, validation, and test datasets.
Load the Inception Model:

Load the Inception model with pre-trained weights, such as InceptionV3 or InceptionResNetV2.
Freeze the base model layers to retain pre-trained weights for initial training.
Add Custom Layers:

Add custom layers on top of the Inception model, including layers for flattening, dense layers, and a final layer with the number of classes (12, in this case).
Compile the Model:

Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy), and metric (e.g., accuracy).
Train the Model:

Train the model using the training and validation datasets.
Specify the number of epochs, batch size, and any callbacks like ModelCheckpoint or EarlyStopping.
Evaluate the Model:

After training, evaluate the model on the test dataset to measure performance.
Save the Model:

Save the trained model for future inference or deployment.
Perform Predictions (Optional):

Use the saved model to perform predictions on new or unseen images.
